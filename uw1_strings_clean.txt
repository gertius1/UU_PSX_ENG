008=Oh,is that all?
009=Can I help?
010=I shall leave thee to thy grief.
011=I shared the great dream of Sir Cabirus,that the Avatar's way could be pursued by all folk.We sought to gather all intelligent species here in the Abyss and teach them to live in harmony.Alas,it was not to be.
012=The constant bickering proved too much for kindly Sir Cabirus,and he perished in his sleep.Some said he was poisoned,but I know he died of a broken spirit.

007=Pardon I did not mean to insult thee with flattery.
008=Thou hast a fine tongue,and a sense of courtesy.Hast thou other Virtues as well?
009=I am a paragon,embodying every Virtue,milord.
010=None worth mentioning,milord.
011=Call me that again,and thy tongue shall wag without thy head around it!
012=That is quite enough.Hast thou some reason for coming here?
013=I would see thy hoard.
014=I'm looking for adventure.
015=I bring thee this gift.
016=Thou shalt see it for thyself.Take thee to the end of the hall from which thou didst enter and say the words "Deco Morono" to the guard at the door.
017=I thank thee.
018=Thou art truly a noble dwarf.
019=Well.Thou art aware that it is customary to offer a gift when granted an audience?

094='Tis a fine gift.I thank thee kindly.
095=Thou art welcome.Farewell.
096=I am glad you enjoy it.
097=Zounds.A larger lump of gold I have never seen.Surely thou art deserving of this axe,an honored weapon that has been passed down from the time of my ancestors.Use it well,for there are few weapons better.

034=We later granted them their freedom,and equal citizenship,though all knew we did them more honor than they were worth.And see how they rewarded us.They split off when Cabirus' "civilization" fell,and have opposed us ever since.Only my leadership has kept us together in the face of such opposition.
035=Such a job must have many cares.
036=Have the Greens no redeeming value?
037=I am glad.Farewell.
038=None whatever.They are distrusting,vindictive,and calculating.But enough of them!
039=What d'ye want?
040=I need to find a girl.
041=I seek to know of Cabirus.
042=You have helped me already.I must be going.
043=A human fool named Cabirus convinced many of our people to come here and colonize this accursed place.When his dreams were shown to be mere folly,he killed himself -- by taking poison -- and left us to our fates.
044=Tragic!
045=Ah,well,I must be going now.Goodbye!
046=Indeed,'tis not fair.Still,we must persevere.Was there anything else?
047=No.I thank thee.Farewell.
048=I need to find a girl.
049=I seek to know of Cabirus.

054=Pardon,I must be going.

059=Well,ye know now.Good-bye!

002=Greetings,Goblin-Lord.
003=All Hail the Mighty Ruler of the Green Goblins.

006=Thou shalt wait some time for my return.Goodbye!
007=Pardon,your Majesty,I had not expected to meet such nobility here.
008=Fair greetings to thee.For what reason hast thou intruded on our court?
009=I am seeking information.
010=I seek to drink from the fountain of thy wisdom,O pearl among kings.
011=True.I AM rather wise,come to think of it.What dost thou wish to know?
012=Who was Sir Cabirus?
013=What are the Talismans?
014=Tell me of the races.
015=How came you by that gorgeous cloak?
016=Well...Perhaps thou canst be forgiven.This place IS full of the most frightfully rude people.Thou mayst remain.What is thy need?
017=Merely to partake in some small manner of thy vast knowledge.
018=Nothing.I'm leaving.
019=I require information.
020=I've changed my mind about thee.Thou art indeed a ruffian.Get thee hence!
021=Thou hast the manners of an acid slug.Get out of here!
022=Thou art wasting my time! Away with thee!
023=Perhaps you couldst stand a little further downwind?
024=I do beg thy pardon.
025=Thou art a dandified fool!
026=It does suit me,doesn't it.I had it made especially for me.One simply doesn't find work like this underground.Well,perhaps the Mountain-folk do make a few nice things,but they tend toward metals rather than clothes.And of course the Seers -- the Ancient Illuminated Seers of the Moonstone,they call themselves -- they do nice work,too.But they generally tend more toward the literary than the sartorial arts.
027=Who was Sir Cabirus?
028=What are the Talismans?
029=Tell me of the groups.
030=And this hall.It is most beautiful.
031=Well,one does what one can.Of course those awful Gray Goblins took all the really nice things with them when they stole away in the night -- this was just after Sir Cabirus died,you know,when things were falling apart.
032=One of these days I'm going to get some poison into Ketchaval or his ugly wife (which amounts to the same thing -- he's terribly henpecked,you know),and then we'll see what's what.King of the Gray Goblins,indeed.\m
033=Why he's an upstart.His father was a horse-thief! But enough of this ...You wanted to know something.How can I help you?
034=What are the Talismans?
035=Who was Sir Cabirus?
036=Tell me of the groups.
037='Tis very kind of thee to take time, your majesty.
038=Oh,mention it not.It is so seldom that I get a chance to speak to a really intelligent person! I mean,our allies the Lizardmen are nice enough,but the poor fellows can't speak a word of the common tongue.They understand it well enough,but the poor things don't have the mouth to speak it.
039=And their language is so difficult! I know "Sseth" and "'click" mean "yes" and "no," but I don't know which is which!\m
040=Then there are the Knights of the Crux Ansata -- they can talk well enough,but all they ever say is how many Trolls they've killed.Frightful bore,even if it does help keep the pest population down -- both kinds of pests,Knights AND Trolls,you know.
041=It must be a trial,even for one noble as yourself.
042=What of these Talismans?
043=Who was Sir Cabirus?
044=Tell me of the groups.
045=Oh,indeed it is.Sometimes I wonder how I even manage.It wasn't always like this,you know.When Sir Cabirus was alive,things were ever so much better.He had all of us working together so well.A born leader was that man.
046=When he founded this colony you could have made a wager anywhere in Britannia that it wouldn't work,but he made it so.There were certain items,too...\m
047=Well,I suppose it will do no harm to tell thee.Sir Cabirus collected eight great Talismans,each embodying a certain Virtue -- he was a great one for Virtue,was our Cabirus -- and it was well known that he intended them to come to the leaders of the various groups here in the Abyss.Well,WE never saw them.If they still exist,they must be lost.But I must be boring thee.
048=Well,actually,yes.
049=No,not at all.
050=I could listen forever,but I've taken enough of thy time.
051=Well,bless you,you're such a charming conversationalist.Please do visit again.
052=Well.I never!
053=Well thou hast now!
054=I beg thy pardon,but I must go now.
055=Oh,thou'rt just saying that.I'm sure there's much more for thee to do than listen me me natter on.And if you should happen to meet "King" Ketchaval or "Queen" Retichall of the Gray Goblins,be a dear and stick a knife in them,would you?
056=Farewell,your Majesty.

007=Why hast thou come here?
008=I seek to join thy Order.
009=I am in search of Cabirus' Talismans.
010=I merely wish to speak.
011=To learn of thy order.
012=Although I am the leader of this order,it is not my duty to select the candidates for membership.Thou must be invited by a current member of the order if thou dost wish to become a member.Go,speak to them and return to me when it is appropriate.
013=I shall,and thank thee.

019=Identify thyself,so I may know whom I query.
020=A valiant warrior,skilled in combat.
021=Perhaps if thou wert as skilled in the virtue of humility,thou wouldst be more suited for our order.
022=A noble of Britannia,worthy of knighthood.
023=That is admirable.However,I am not sure we currently have a spot...\p No,we do not.Perhaps another time.
024=The poor @SS1 of my mother.
025=That is plain.Art thou willing to sacrifice thy life to join our Order?
026=Yes,I am.
027=No!
028=Wait.I can explain!
029=And dost thou submit to our Justice?
030=Indeed,I do.
031=No,I do not.
032=We should discuss this.
033=Very well.Thou hast earned death by coming here,and thou shalt have thy reward.Here is a cup,which bears within it a venom both swift and deadly.Take it and drink it.
034=Very well.
035=And if I refuse?
036=Then thou art no candidate worthy of our Order! Leave here,and return when thou art.
037=Ah,good Sir Cabirus.Many of our Order seek his Talismans,for they are said to confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.I cannot,however,share our knowledge about these things with one who is not an initiate of our Order.
038=May I join thy Order?
039=Very well.I understand.Good day to thee.
040=You take the cup.Within it is a is a clear,odorless liquid.You raise it to your lips and ...
041=Fling it to the floor.
042=Drink it in a draught.

045=Yes.
046=No.
047=Good.To know fear is the first step to knowing Valor.Thou art now a Squire of this Order.\m
048=Thy quest is to find the writ of Lorne,a document written by one of the the first Knights who settled this order in the Abyss.The document was written during the early years of the Colony,and it contains much knowledge of that time.However,it is now gone,though many suspect it is in the troll homeland.Seek it,and when thou returns here with it,a knight of our order thou wilt become.
049=Thank thee.Fare thee well.
050=Thank thee.Canst thou tell me of Cabirus' Talismans?
+=055=Brother
+=056=Sister
051=Precious little.They numbered eight,and Cabirus did intend them to go each to one of the Leaders of the eight groups who settled the Abyss.Alas,he perished,and all eight were lost.'Tis said they were a Book,bottle of Wine,a Shield,a Sword,a Taper,a Standard,a Cup,and a Ring.Each was imbued with the potent power of a single Virtue,and 'tis said they confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.\m
052=Of the Standard thou dost know,since thou hast earned it by defeating Rodrick,the Chaos Knight.The Taper was stolen,unfortunately.Thou seest how the virtues have suffered since the death of Cabirus.
053=I know only of the Taper and the Standard.The Taper of Sacrifice was stolen from us only recently,and we know not its current whereabouts.As for the Standard of Honor,it is said that it is awaiting one who would perform a sufficiently honorable deed.
054=Farewell,Brother, thanks!
055=Goodbye.
056=That is good.To learn is to better oneself.How may we advance thy knowledge?
057=Tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus.
058=Tell me of the Trolls.
059=Tell me of thy order.
060=The Trolls.They are our ancient foes.We are fortunate in that many of them are honorable,in their own way.Some are not,of course.Feral Trolls,we call them.Beware of these.All are deadly foes,but at least the civilized ones fight honorably.
061=Thank thee for the advice.
062=Thy standards appeal to me.How may I join thy Order?

073=Now thou art @SS1 @GS8,Knight of the Order of the Crux Ansata.Take thou this helm of plate,worthy of a Knight.Would that we had a horse to give thee as well,for 'tis proper for a Knight.
074=I'll just put it on the floor for thee.
075=Are there any more lost artifacts in need of retrieval?
076=How else may I serve the Order?
077=Thou hast done well; thy quest is accomplished.Well done!\m
078=No,I am afraid that is not the writ.
079=Perhaps this is it.
080=I will return when I have found it.
081=Good luck in thy continuing quest.
082=There shall be no discussion.Thou mayst go or stay,and accept the consequences of thy decision.
083=I shall stay.
084=Very well.
085=I shall be going.
086=Return when thou art truly ready to become an initiate of our order.
087=Thy quest is accomplished.Well done! All things that belong to the order now belon.to thee.I have opened the door to the armory,and thou mayst go there and take items as thou dost need them to accomplish the quests and goals thou dost set for thyself.
088=Now what wouldst thou have of me?
089=I thank thee.Now I must be going.
090=That is not it.Try again.
091=All that I can tell thee I have told.Seek the virtues on thy own through what is left of our once noble colony.Good luck and honor on thy quests.
092=Thou hast killed the bastard knight who held the north of our home to be his.I thank thee for bringing honor back to our order and clearing the villain from our homes.The action thou hast taken has proven that thou art most worthy.To reward thee for thy deeds,I offer thee the Standard of Honor,one of the Talismans fashioned by Cabirus.
093=My thanks.I am honored indeed to bear it.
094=No thank you.I would not know what to do with it.
095=Hast thou reconsidered my offer?
096=Yes,I desire the standard of honor.
097=No,I must be going.
098=No,but I would like to speak with thee.
099=I shall speak with thee,but I strongly urge thee to take this standard.
100=Dorna turns and rummages through a large iron case,returning soon with a golden standard which he holds before you.
101=Here it is.Bear it with honor and remember those who bore it before thee.Honor their memory with thy deeds,for the deed.thou hast already done honor thee in our memory.
102=Here,I'll just put it on the floor for you.
103=I thank thee,and shall take thy words to heart.
104=If thou dost ever desire it,return to me and ask for it.
105=I shall,and soon.
106=Both it and I shall be waiting.
107=Thou shalt wait a long time afore I return.
108=We shall see.
109=The order once owned a golden plate.Years ago it was stolen by a thief who I will not even describe,for he is not worth the time it would take.He fled into the maze and was not seen again.Since then,it was rumored to have been found several times.The last rumor placed it at the grave of Sir Ingvar.Find it and thou wilt rise even further as a Knight.
110=I thank thee.Until we meet again...
111=Another quest.Is there no end?
112=Thou hast seen the truth of it.The quest for enlightenment is never-ending.Yet,if thou dost persist in this small quest,thou mayst find rewards to help the.on the greater quest.
113=Very well.Until we meet again...
114=I am sorry to hear it.Hast spoken to all in this area.Surely someone can help thee?
115=If I must...Farewell.
116=I'll try.Until we meet again...
117=Thou art one of us now.Thou art always welcome here.
118=I thank thee and am glad to hear that.
119=Wouldst thou please reopen the armory?
120=Surely.I'll have it done right away.
121=What canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus' Talismans?
122=Well I am glad thou desirest my company.However,I am a very busy man,and I don't have time now to talk.Many of the knights of the order are willing to reminisce and talk.Thou shouldst seek them out.
123=Thank thee,and farewell.
124=Canst thou just tell me of the nature of thy order?
125=Our goal is that of the Avatar - to advance in our knowledge of virtue,in order to better ourselves.When a quest presents itself that will further our understanding of virtue,we undertake it gladly.Perhaps our quests also make Britannia a better place.\m
126=Unfortunately,Rodrick,one of our order,recently abandoned his principles and took up residence in the banquet hall to the north,calling himself the "Chaos Knight" and terrorizing the inhabitants of that area.We sent one of our knights,Biden,to defeat him,but he has not returned.I fear the worst.
127=Thank thee,and farewell.
128=May I join thy order?
129=Perhaps I could defeat him.
130=That would be most honorable of thee,if thou didst truly defeat him and restore peace to our settlement.But I must warn thee that he is an opponent as dishonorable as he is dangerous,and he would not likely spare thy life were he to outfight thee.
131=I will take care with him.
132=May I join thy order?
133=Thank thee for thy advice,and farewell.

053=Before I do,what IS this place?
054=It was not always such.Once,a leader name Sir Cabirus (curst be his name!) had the foolish notion that this place could be colonized.When his folly caught up with him,the "civilization" of the under-earth fell,and we now scrabble to survive in its ruins.He died,and so escaped the punishment for his crime.Dreamers.They will be the death of us all!

009=What do I look like,a drawbridge?
010=In fact,thou bearest resemblance to one.
011=Thy point is made.How did you come to be a door?
012=I once was a young human like thyself.But I grew weary of the regular folk and their immense stupidity.I was a brilliant mage,and was constantly pestered with silly questions,such as "How does one cast Sheet Lightning?" Tiring of being hounded thus,I turned myself into a door in order to finally enjoy some peace and quiet.Obviously,it didn't work.
013=Now that thou dost mention it,how does one cast Sheet Lightning?
014=Canst thou not turn thyself back into a human?
015=Gaaah.I cannot believe thou wouldst ask that,of all questions.I should have known better than to mention that accursed spell.If thou must know,it is cast by using the Vas,Ort and Grav runestones.There.I hope that thou blowest thyself up with it.

001=Thou hast done well.And now that my bones are at last at rest I can speak freely to thee.But my spirit cannot rest while yet this peril remains.We must open a gate,near where the foul creature my brother summoned lies bound.We must return it to the plane from whence it came.
002=Is there no other way?
003=How can we open such a gate?
004=No other power can defeat it.Even banishing it to another place will do it no harm -- may in fact restore to it its full power,if that place be like to its own -- but it will at least remove the threat to Britannia!
005=How can this be done?
006=For this I will need a great deal of magical energy.This will be no gentle luring such as brought thee here,but an unimaginable vortex of interplanar energy.
007=Might Tyball's Orb have sufficed,had it not been destroyed?
008=Where can we find such powerful magic?
009=Tyball's Orb would be perilous to use,even if it were intact.The power we tap must be carefully chosen...As thou may have guessed,I am a little out of touch with thy world.I had hoped thou might provide an answer.
010=I'm afraid I have no idea.
011=What be the qualifications for what thou needest?
012=It would be best if the source were absolutely pure -- my brother found the danger in tapping powers whose source thou knowest not -- and 'twould be best if Britannia herself were somehow involved.
013=How dost thou mean,"Britannia involved?"

015='Twould help to invoke one of the Elements.We work for Britannia's succor,and we must hope she would lend what aid she could.

019=The classical four: earth,air,fire,and water.
020=Indeed she is,a green and living entity.Not conscious as we know it,but perhaps aware that we work to her ends.
021=Yes,the source,which,if we are fortunate,may even wake Britannia to our aid,should be as pure as possible.Else we risk ending like my brother.

027=No that won't work. Rather something else.
028=Perhaps thou shouldst ponder the problem for a bit longer.But think carefully and quickly,for the fate of Britannia is at stake!
029=Perhaps some item or items imbued with Virtue might be of use,if any exist.Dost thou know of any such items?
030=Yes,of course.Those would do admirably.Now,we must find a means to unleash their stored Virtue.We must find some latent source of power that can be released by applying the energy of the Talismans.
031=I cannot think of anything appropriate.
032=Other...
033=What about the energy of the volcano and lava?
034=I can use my magic power!
035=No,we need a great source of power that might easily be released.
036=Well,I hope that thou art able to solve the problem quickly,for the fate of Britannia itself hangs in the balance!
037=Perhaps some natural landmark that contains the ability to release great power will do the trick.
038=Yes,of course.If all eight Talismans be thrust into the volcano's maw,one at a time,I could ride the wave of such power to open the vortex.Ah,thou art wise as well as valorous.Wilt thou make such a sacrifice?
039=Thou knowest not the troubles I went through to obtain those!
040=Aye,though it pains me to lose such tools as these.
041=But thou must.Thy sacrifice shall save all of this world.Surely thou cannot place thine own travails and successes against such a stake as that!
042=Very well,thou art correct.I shall do it!
043=I shall think on it.
044=Excellent.Make haste to the lowest place,where thou must cast all eight into the Abyss -- hold back not one,upon thy peril.When they are consumed by earth's own fire,I shall leash the torrent to gape wide my gate.With Fortune's smile,we shall send our foe screeching back to its Hell!
045=Where can I find a way into the volcano?
046=Very well.Look for me there!
047=The Chamber of Virtue is located on the lowest level of the Abyss.It lies at the very center of the volcano,where the energy fields of the Stygian are their strongest.'Tis said that a special three-part key is needed to enter,but I know not the veracity of this legend.
048=I will make my way there.
049=Hurry.There is little time to lose!
050=Hurry,@GS8,there is no time to lose.Thou must cast all eight of Cabirus' Talismans into the volcano on the lowest level of the Abyss.Do not fail in thy quest!
051=Yes.Hast thou discovered a source of energy with which the power of Cabirus' Talismans can be released?

004=I am exploring the Abyss.
005=I am attempting to rescue an innocent girl.
006=I serve a punishment for a crime I did not commit.
007=Exploring,eh.Ha,that's a good one.But if thou dost not wish to speak of thy crime,'tis not my business to ask.\m
008=Ah,a rescue mission,is it.Should the Baron's guards not be with thee,to aid thee in thy search.More likely one of them threw thee in here,eh?\m
009=Ah,unjustly imprisoned,art thou.'Tis the usual story,my @SS1,but that is not to say it may not be true in thy case,I suppose.\m
010=Thou needst not be ashamed of thy misfortune,@SS1; thou art in the same pot with all of us now.If thou art to have a chance of surviving in the Abyss for long,thou must learn the lay of the land.
011=Indeed,I would be eager to learn of this area.
012=I will be able to manage  by myself.
013=Perhaps thou wilt.I have heard many say the same as thee,and a few are still alive today.
014=Well,what useful information dost thou have?
015=Farewell,then.
016=First off,I would suggest picking up anything thou dost find that seems of use.Items here are scarce enough - thou wouldst be well advised to take what thou can.Scavenge all you want,but stealing is ill-advised.
017=Most of the Abyss' inhabitants guard jealously the few possessions that they have.Battlesites are the best for scavenging.That's why I'm here - A battle took place here not long ago - a battle between the Goblins and the above-worlders.
018=Who inhabits the Abyss?
019=What was the cause of this battle?
020=I do not know.It is rare that the Baron sends his men into the Abyss.It must have been important.Though,by the looks of it,the Goblins defeated them handily.\m
021=The Goblins control most of these upper caves.Two races there are,the Green and the Gray.If they do not destroy each other,it is not for lack of trying.Be thou especially careful of the Gray Goblins.I was recently imprisoned by them for trespassing.
022=It must have been awful!
023=How didst thou escape?
024=My prison cell was evidently a converted storeroom,for it had a stock of useful items,including a long pole.Using the pole,I was able to reach a button which opened the door to my cell.I sneaked away and returned to my people.I do not think I will venture there again.
025=And what of the other inhabitants of the Abyss?
026=Tell me of thy people.
027=The humans,like thee and myself,have staked out a small area in which we live in relative peace.Below us are the Mountainmen,and after that I do not know.
028=Where is this enclave of humans?
029=Are all races but ours hostile?
030=A nasty place this is,thou canst be certain of that.In the parts of the upper caves,uninhabited by Goblins,there are giant spiders and worms.Our small group is one of the few devoted to peace.\m
031=Thou canst find my people by going west from the entrance to the Abyss,and then north.There is a small chasm to jump over,but thou dost seem to be a dextrous @SS1.Past the chasm is the sign of civilization everywhere throughout the Abyss: the Banner of Cabirus,marked with an ankh,the sign of the Avatar.Outside of areas marked with the Banner,thou shouldst watch thyself most carefully.Most creatures who do not respect Cabirus' legacy are not particularly friendly.
032=Perhaps I will seek this area out.
033=I thank thee for thy help.
034=Good luck in thy travels.
035=Greetings again.I am glad to see that thou hast lived this long.It is not easy for one to survive in the Abyss without the help of others.
036=It is easy for me.I have no need of thy help.
037=Well then,what helpful information canst thou tell me?
038=Greetings @SS1.Hast thou visited our group?
039=I have not had the time.
040=I have not been able to find it.
041=Yes,I have.
042=Well,'tis thy decision.I am sure they would welcome thee.
043=Go west from the entrance chamber,past a door,and then north over a chasm.Remember,the Banner of Cabirus -- with the mark of the ankh on it -- is the mark of civilization in the Abyss.
044=I am glad to hear it.If thou growest weary of thy travels,thou art welcome to stay with us.
045=I thank thee kindly.
046=I thank thee,but my destiny lies elsewhere.
047=Ah,'tis thee again.Hast thou decided to stay with us?
048=I think not.
049=No,I have much to do.
050=Perhaps I will,for a time.

011=It sounds awful.
012=There must be some good points to being a miner.

Go ye to the northern part of these mines and see for yourself the beauty of a gold mine.

016=Ach,ye've come to the right place.There is no treasure better than gold,and gold there is in abundance in these mines.In the north parts of these mines especially,ye shall find a beautiful sight.Be careful of the monster that's been seen around those parts,though.Now,what else might ye want to know?
017=The monster of the mines.A great boon it would be if ye did defeat it,but I don't know that it can be done.A fearsome thing it is.Caught it once out of the corner of me eye,and I don't care to see it again.It lurks in the north part of these mines.

009=I may succumb to hunger ere long.
010=Tell me more of the perils that lie ahead.
011=I must prove my innocence at any cost.
012=Yet,with thy aid,my chances might improve.
013=How dost thou survive?
014=Canst tell me aught of what lies ahead?
015=I will not be stopped.
016=Canst thou aid me?
017=By the bright and glittering stars of heaven,which I have not seen these many years,I wish I had food to give thee.Yet,I do not.I can,however,tell thee something which,as the ancient prover.states,may feed thee for life.Mind thee,many have been cast into the Abyss with the empty promises of the hypocrite Almric,and met with a far more grisly demise than mere starvation.\m
018=Still,my words are as useless as shouting upwind in a hurricane.More to the point,thou mayest find a pond but a little north of here,where fish will leap from the wate.and onto thy pole,more numerous than vultures upon a carcass th.jackals have forsaken.
019=If thou dost employ the pole I gave thee,thou shall have all the fish thou may desire.
020=I have an extra pole,if thou dost need one.
021=I thank thee heartily for thy generosity.
022=Thou art kind,but I need it not.
023=I wish thee well.I once believed in noble causes myself.Now I find that just surviving is a noble enough fight.'Tis easier to drink water from a sieve than escape from the Abyss alive.If thou dost seek trouble,it shal.find thee 'ere long.
024=Farewell,and fortune favor thee.
025=I cannot shun the call of duty.
026=I have little urge to seek trouble.I have outlived many in the Abyss by having the good sense to keep myself out of harm's way.Thou wouldst be wise to do the same.
027=Canst thou tell me anything that might aid me?
028=I'll seek advice from one who lives more honorably.
029='Tis said that against hunger the gods themselves contend i.vain.Still,Britannia was not built in a day.I can tell thee this much,at least: To the north but a short way is a pond,as full of fish as the day is long.
030=If thou but put the pole I gave thee to its proper use,thou shalt have fish aplenty.
031=That is sage advice,friend.I will go at once.
032=I fear fish do not agree with my stomach.Goodbye.
033=I have an extra fishing pole.Dost thou want it?
034=Thank thee.I gladly accept thy pole.
035='Tis a kind offer,but I have no need of it.
036=I fear I can tell thee little of what lies ahead.I have found that those seeking trouble in the nether regions of the Abyss find it eager to make their acquaintance.
037=How dost thou survive here,if thou liv'st in fear?
038=Do you know the area?
039=Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
040=I take care to keep myself far from trouble's path,and fish for my food.
041=Where dost thou fish?
042=I have more pressing matters to attend to.
043=Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
044=If thou but venture northward,thou shalt soon come across a pond so thick with fish thou couldst walk across without getting thy boots wet.
045=Use the pole there,and thou shalt soon have food in abundance.
046=I shall.Thank thee.
047=Perhaps I shall later.
048=I can give thee my spare fishing pole,if thou dost need it.
049=I do need one.Thank thee kindly.
050=I need it not.
051=No I haven't.I should go.
052=Good bye.
053=Thou shouldst learn more of Valor.
054=Look,there he is,right behind thee!
055=May thy casts be ever fruitful.
056=Thank thee,and thine too.
057=Art feeling more talkative than when last I saw thee?
058=No.I have no time for the likes of thee.
059=Aye.Who art thou?
060=Greetings,friend.Hast thou caught any fish?
061=Aye,more than the sands of the desert.
062=Excellent!
063=I have not tried.
064=Never mind that.Dost thou know aught of an evil wizard nearby?
065=Welcome back.In sooth,thou art lucky to have survived so long,friend.The Abyss is a place of fearsome peril.
066=I am an outcast,trying to survive amidst the fearsome perils of the Abyss.I am surprised thou hast lived so long in spite of thy surly disposition.
067=Wouldst thou be interested in a trade?
068=Yes.
069=No.
070=I make thee this offer.
071=I demand you give me this!
072=I must appraise this deal.
073=I do not wish to continue.
074=Farewell.
075=Thou hast a deal!
076=Thy offer does not interest me.
077=What kind of fool dost thou take me for?
078=I grow weary of this petty haggling.
079=That is no trade!
080=Art thou attempting to intimidate me into surrendering my possessions?
081=Yes,I must.
082=No,thou mistakest my meaning entirely.
083=If thou art desperate enough to steal,I will not oppose thee.
084=Miscreant.I shall teach thee a lesson!

001=Hail,stranger.`Tis indeed a rare pleasure to encounter a new face amongst the denizens of the Abyss.What hast brought thee hither?
002=I must prove I am innocent of a kidnapping.
003=I'd rather not say.
004=Suit thyself,friend.`Tis thy business,not mine.
005=A terrible crime,indeed.I would fain believe thou art innocent of such,for thy face has honor in it.Thou dost wear it like few I have beheld in my many years in the Abyss.May I help thee in any way?
006=Why art thou here?
007=Hast thou heard aught of a princess?
008=Canst thou tell me of this region of the Abyss?
009=Like thee,I was unjustly accused of killing a man.I swear to thee I never struck him.I merely held him down whilst my brother kicked him.He should not have treated our sister as he did.And only a weak man could perish from such slight injuries.
010=Methinks thou art guilty as an accomplice.
011=Indeed,Almric's justice is a blind archer.
012=I fear I canst tell thee nothing new.
013=It is said the trolls have captured a new dweller in the Abyss.\m
014=I have heard there is to be a human sacrifice in Cabirus' old quarters on the lowest level.\m
015=A Knight told me that a maiden's body had been found in the lower levels.\m
016=In their search for some new advantage over the trolls,th.Knights explore more widely than I.Mayhap they can tell thee more.Still,be careful,lest thou become the next casualty in their senseless battle with the trolls.
017=It may be the Knights can tell thee something,for they travel more of the Abyss than I.
018=Tell me of these Knights.
019=I have problems enough of my own.
020=There is much tension on this level of the Abyss.The Knights inhabit the western area,and a pack of Trolls live in the eastern reaches.Even while Sir Cabirus was alive,there was an uneasy peace between them.After Cabirus' death,there was some strife,as each group attempted to gain power over the other,but these days there is relative peace.\m
021=Perhaps the greatest danger in this area now is Rodrick,known as the Chaos Knight.He lives by the old banquet hall to the north.He is the foe of both the Knights and the Trolls,but neither has been able to defeat him yet.I hear that Dorna Ironfist has put a price upon his head.
022=Thank thee for thy information.
023=Hast thou heard news of a captive virgin?
024=And methinks thou art a self-righteous ass,who wouldst b.well-suited in the company of the pompous Knights with their overweening morals.Thy inflated ego wouldst find much company there.
025=In sooth,thou speakest with a wisdom beyond thy years.friend.What I wouldst not give to teach that tyrant Almric a lesson about justice and honor.I would deal him a buffeting that would leave his heirs dizzy for generations to come.\m
026=Would I could aid thee more,friend,but I know little.I have heard tell that a maiden is held captive near Cabirus'.quarters far below.Perhaps the Knights could tell thee more.
027=What dost thou know of the Knights?
028=I will take thy advice to heart.
029=Well met,friend.How dost thou in thy quest?
030=Not well.Hast thou any news for me?
031=Well.I must soon head to the lower levels.
032=In sooth,I am sorry to hear thee pronounce thy own death sentence.Good luck,for thou wilt need it if you are to have any hope of surviving below.

004=Ah,the adventurous life is not for me.I am content to remain here and work at my craft.
005=Perhaps thou art simply a coward.
006=What is thy craft?
007=Despite thy words,many feel that it is more important to contribute to society by one's work than by one's sword.
008=How dost thou contribute?
009=Perhaps thou art correct.What is thy work?
010=I have no time for those not as valorous as I.
011=I carve gems and work metals.It is hard and tedious work,especially with poor tools,but I am content with it nonetheless.
012=I wish I could help thee with thy work.
013=Would this item help thee?
014=Not all avocations are equally exciting.
015=Well,if thou hast anything that would help me in my work,I would appreciate it.Perhaps thou hast collected such an item in thy travels.
016=Will this help?
017=If I do find such an item,I shall let thee know.

019=No,I insist - take it.
020=Very well.
021=That is too kind of thee.I cannot tell thee how much it will help me in my work.Thou hast demonstrated much humility by giving away this artifact - it is only right that I tell thee of the Ring of Humility.\m
022=There is a room in the northwest portion of the level below us.There you will find four switches.Flip them in this order: northwest,southeast,northeast,and southwest.Be careful to stay out of the middle of the room.

003=This really isn't much,despite thy claims.
004=I have nothing to say to thee.
005=If that is what thou wishest.
006=Wait! I must speak with thee.
007=Thou hast returned.What dost thou wish to speak of?
008=Nothing.Farewell.
009=The order of the Crux Ansata.
010=This taper that was lost.
011=It is good to see thee again.Thou wilt go down in the history of our order as the brave soul who found the Taper of Sacrifice that was so long lost.I thank thee again.
012=Our order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss,and has had many virtuous members.In the chaos that followed Cabirus' death,we attempted to collect the Talismans of virtue.However,most were already lost,some supposedly destroyed.
013=We did have the Taper of Sacrifice,briefly,but it was taken by some lunatic.Supposedly the Standard of Honor is somewhere as well,merely awaiting an honorable deed.
014=Tell me about this taper.
015=We had it,but a while ago a lunatic raided our quarters and stole many things.
016=Thank you for the information.
017=It is my pleasure to provide information to a member of the order.
018=The order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss,and has had many virtuous members.More I cannot say to one who is not a member,but thou mayst return to me once thou art inducted and I can tell thee more.
019=I shall.
020=I doubt I will bother.
021=Well,thy path is thine alone to choose.but I feel it should lie with ours for a while.
022=Hast thou heard tell of it,or even seen it,perhaps?
023=Yes,I have heard others speak of it.
024=That is good news.Continue to search,and thou mayst find it.
025=Yes.Actually,I have it.
026=No.Canst thou tell me more of it?
027=The lunatic who took it fled to the levels above,or so it is told.Perhaps others have heard tell of him,or can otherwise help thee.
028=Farewell.
029=It is in thy possession e'en now.Could thou please show it to me?
030=Very well,here it is.
031=No.It would not be appropriate.
032=Please,may I see it?
033=Please reconsider.
034=I beg of thee,let me but look at it.
035=Thou art indeed cruel,to deny me a glance at the Taper of Sacrifice.
036=That is not the Taper.Return if thou hast truly found it.
037=Ah.To see the taper again,this is good indeed.
038=Ah.It is good to be bathed in the taper's radiance once more.
039=I thank thee for the chance to see the taper again.Now that thou hast found it,it is right that thou dost keep it.Thou wilt find that the light it produces is quite steady,for it continually sacrifices of itself to produce light for thee.
040=Cabirus imbued it with virtue,however,and although it consumes itself constantly to provide light,it is continually replenished as well.
041=I shall keep it then,and keep it safe.
042=Good luck to thee.
043=Thank thee.
044=And I thank thee for finding it.
045=What dost thou want?
046=Nothing.Farewell.
047=Canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus.I thought all had abandoned his dream.
048=Thou hast uttered sacrilege.Recant or face my blade.
049=I must say what I believe.
050=Thou art quite right.This culture is splendid.
051=That is as it must be,as is my slaying thee in the name of my order.
052=That is more appropriate.I trust thou wilt remember this lesson.Leave now.
053=It has been thy misfortune to travel through the other levels of this wasteland,and I am not surprised thou dost think that.However,we still abide by the dreams of Cabirus and the eight virtues.
054=I thought all had abandoned Cabirus' dream.
055=They seem to have failed.Perhaps you should start something new.
056=No! We work still to bring about a return to the days of the Abyss' glory.There is hope yet if the races of the colony wil.believe again in the virtues and in each other.Unfortunately,I think there is little hope.Most of the dwellers in this colony have forgotten what little they may once have known about its purpose.\m
057=Even the most stalwart believers now doubt.No one remembers the virtues any more.It is a sad situation.Why,several month.ago,someone came from above and stole one of the greatest treasures remaining from Cabirus' days.
058=That is tragic.
059=Indeed it was.
060=What was stolen?
061=We lost many small things,mostly from storage.All of our torches and lanterns were taken.A few items of food,but mostly light sources,actually.Quite odd.
062=The grave loss was that of the Taper of Sacrifice,though.It was created by Sir Cabirus himself and imbued with virtue.We placed it in our shrine where we kept a vigil over it.It remained lit for three years.\m
063=But one day a man arrived at one of our guard posts.He ranted and raved,but we let him in,as common courtesy dictates,of course.He started running about and grabbing candles and such.We were all too shocked to respond.Then he grabbed the Taper itself and ran off.
064=By the time we were in armor and ready to give chase we had lost him.A tragedy it was.
065=I shall seek this Taper.
066=I wish thee good luck.Seek it above,for that is where we believe the lunatic came from.
067=I believe that I have found this Taper.
068=It must be hard living in a wild place like this.
069=It is indeed tiresome.But Knights of the Crux are not defeated,regardless of the difficulty of their task.
070=Farewell.

005=To be honest,I am not that impressed.
006=It is quite nice.
007=It must have been quite something in the old days.
008=In better times thou wouldst have seen our true glory.The splendor of our domain and righteousness of our cause were great indeed.But alas,the environs have changed and the walls have fallen down,the just have been silenced by the desperate,and not even the strongest among us can hope to rebuild what Cabirus wrought.
009=What was it like before?
010=Perhaps it should never have been built.
011=It was wonderful.We would visit the ceremonial hall every day.Sometimes we would go below and challenge the Golem to a test of might.There were marvelous banquets.The Mayors of towns throughout Britannia would come to marvel at our achievements.Now none can survive the dangers of this place long enough to reach us.
012=Well,I was able to reach thee.
013=A test of might?

016=Thou didst speak of a test of might.
017=Have you done anything to improve the area?
018=A Golem resides on an island surrounded by lava in the land of the Seers.We would take our swords and shields,leap onto the island,and battle the Golem.It was indestructable,but honorable and valorious.
019=Though it could not be destroyed,it would congratulate thee if thou didst fight well.If thou wert good enough it would sometimes reward thee.
020=The Seers live below,correct?
021=Yes.If the Golem still exists,he would be there.

024=I am glad to hear that some of the quests were successful.
025=Tell me about those who never returned.
026=We heard rumors that a powerful mage on the seventh level of the Abyss was kidnapping and killing people.We sent a party of our most valorous Knights to investigate.They never returned.We hope to mount an expedition to investigate,but our resources are limited.
027=Perhaps this is the same mage I seek.
028=I will investigate this mage myself.
029=Thank thee and farewell.
030=Be thou most careful!If our Knights were unable to defeat him,he must be powerful indeed.
031=Yes,we made great inroads against the trolls at first.And we nearly succeeded in clearing our own demesne of headlesses and other vermin.Our recent quests have been disasters,though,and our order is in trouble.
032=What has gone wrong?
033=I would like to join the order if possible.

001=Welcome,traveller.How can I help thee?
002=That is all I can tell thee of that particular matter.What else art thou interested in?
003=I am sorry but I have no more knowledge to impart to thee.I wish thee good luck in thy quests,whatever they may be and wherever they may take thee.
004=Tell me of this level.
005=What wouldst thou like to know about?
006=Tell me of the Trolls.
007=How did your order come to the Abyss?
008=I thank thee for thy time.
009=My pleasure.
010=Ah,yes,this area is wonderfully designed.We created much of it ourselves,with some help from the artisans of Minoc and the Mountainfolk.There are many regions of interest.Although the Abyssal colony has only existed a short time,it is filled with wonders to match any found in Britannia.
011=Tell me of these wonders.
012=It does not seem very wondrous to me.
013=I have just begun to explore its beauty.
014=In the northeast corner of the level is the Puzzle of the Bullfrog,made by a Mountainfolk craftswoman who had a love of frogs.To the northwest is the Maze of Silas,a stoneworker and lover of deceptive walls.Beyond the maze is the door of precious levers,which opens the gateway to the resting place of one of our order.There is a water-filled area to the west of the Abyss' volcanic core.The waterfall is something to see.Which one would you like to know more about?
015=Puzzle of the Bullfrog.
016=Maze of Silas.
017=Door of precious levers.
018=Watery area.
019=I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
020=Past the puzzle in the northeast there is an entrance to the tombs below.To reach the entrance,one must traverse an area surrounded by water.It is said that by using the levers and buttons in the area,one may create a safe path to the other side.It has been years since the puzzle was created,though,and its solution is now lost.The only clue I know of is that the wand found there will restore the puzzle to its pristine state.
021=I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
022=The Maze of Silas is now infested with pests and littered with debris and bones,but there are said to be other things in the maze as well -- hidden chambers and items of some value.The locations of these chambers and items are unknown now,however,so what they contain I cannot reveal to thee.
023=I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
024=Near the volcano's shaft is a set of falls leading to two pools.One pool is very hard to reach,at least from our domain.But 'tis said it is simple to get there from the Lair of the Lizard-Folk.Would that one among us could speak their tongue and learn the easier route.The second pool is in a secluded spot near a fishing run south of the Abyss' central shaft.
025=I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
026=The puzzle of precious levers is beyond the maze.Although the members of our knighthood will not be specific,it is believed to be in a concealed area.The puzzle itself was built to guard the stores of the old government of the Abyss.Now,however,not one of us could tell thee what lies beyond the closed door.\m
027=The workings of the levers are not understood,but 'tis said that their secrets can be gleaned through careful examination of the artifacts of our order.I have not the patience for such research,but perhaps one who does will solve the mystery.
028=I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
029=They are indeed a vicious and dangerous race.I would call them indecent,but that was not Cabirus' way,and I strive not to make it mine.They are,truth be told,honorable in their own way.Only a few of them still cling to any shreds of the Abyss' purpose,though.Some have reverted to their natural,combative state.They are monsters,and powerful ones,at that.
030=How can one pass through their realm safely?
031=I suppose I should be ready to fight.
032=Ready,yes,but not eager.
033=I can handle them.
034=Part of a knight's goal is to be a good fighter,it is true.But a good fighter does not rejoice in a battle for its own sake.Thy blade is an ally only when it is used with honor and justice.When it is used for needless bloodshed,it stains thy honor and the honor of thy order.Do not fight for the sake of killing.Fight for thy life,the life of those thou art sworn to defend,and to eliminate those that threaten our realm.Fighting for the sake of blood is a short road to death.
035=Thou needst not fight continually to survive their realm.In the south,where the main meeting hall of the Trolls used to be,there are still Trolls who respect Cabirus' purpose.They can tell thee more of the realm.Beware the Dark Trolls - they are more powerful even than the normal ones.\m
036=Also beware the northern parts of their realm,for they have been invaded by spiders,headlesses,and worse.These monsters will provide enough trouble,so don't attack Trolls unless they attack thee first.Thou wilt have enough trouble staying alive without picking fights.
037=We came here from Jhelom.The fairest town in Britannia,that I can say with certainty.Been to them all I have,and none compare.
038=Thou dost speak truly.
039=It certainly is a fine town.
040=Thou dost think so.I disagree.
041=The colony of the Abyss was an achievement unparalleled in recent times.Eight cultures mixing in one environment,and getting along splendidly.We had some banquets that were spectacular,I tell thee.They rivaled the best of parties that even Jhelom could offer.We would all gather just to the northeast of here in the banquet hall.We would stay up all night -- though of course it is hard to tell down here -- and recount tales of our homelands,our rituals,and our friends.\m
042=Now all we do is fight for food and space.Truly the death of Cabirus was the death of the Colony of the Stygian Abyss.Still,we try,for it is all we can do to honor his legacy and dream.
043=Perhaps the inhabitants of Jhelom were not perfect,but they were certainly more courteous than thee.

003=I see that thou art more interested in conversing than in fighting.A true warrior thou art not.
004=Have the Knights sent thee.So much the better,as thy defeat will be a lesson to them all!
005=If thou wert as intelligent as thou art talkative,thou wouldst have fled long ago.
006=Thy bravery is admirable,but thy skill is not.
007=Perhaps I should have warned thee earlier that I am invincible.
008=Thou hast not had enough of my sword.I have certainly had enough of thy tongue.

001=Hast thou managed to defeat the villain Rodrick?
002=No,I have not seen him.
003=He lives in the north part of the banquet hall,in the area with the dark marbled wall.and the sloped halls.Thou shalt find him there!\m
004=We fought,but I was not able to defeat him.
005=He is a tough opponent,and quite strong.Find advantageous terrain and move often to keep him from simply overpowering thee.Watch out for his slash.Good luck to thee.\m
006=I think so.
007=I thought I heard him in the distance just a moment ago.Perhaps thou didst mistake someone else for  him.\m
008=Thou art a member of my order.Thou too dost strive to uphold the ideals of honor espoused by our order.Thou dost understand the virtues,and understand the ways of knighthood.Please listen to my tale.
009=Thou dost seem valorous and just,well equipped for the grave peril of the Abyss,and ready to brave the dangers of this area.Please listen to my tale.
010=I would be happy to hear thy story.
011='Tis not a happy story,but I'll tell it all the same.\m
012=I shall.Begin it at once.
013=I am quite busy.Perhaps some other time.
014=Sir Rodrick was once a member of our order,but abandoned the principles of our order and now calls himself the Chaos Knight,terrorizing the entire northern area.Since to attack one with many would be dishonorable,our leader Dorna picked me to defeat him in single combat.\m
015=When I reached the old banquet hall to the north,I was suddenly attacked by Rodrick,who leaped from a ledge above me and took me off guard.He attacked relentlessly,and although I hit him several times,my own blows did little to slow him or curb his apparent anger.He taunted me continuously as we fought,and would not listen as I attempted to reason with him.\m
016=I am surprised that thou art still alive.
017=How did the battle finally end?
018=After several minutes I was bleeding from several wounds and thinking my time was up.In desperation,I flung my sword at him.He blocked it easily,but the distraction allowed me to run from him.\m
019=So that is my story.I can not return to my home until I have eliminated Rodrick and restored our order's honor,but it will be some time now before I am capable of fighting.So I wait here,far from the Trolls and other pests,gathering my strength before I head off again.
020=Thou art going to attack him again?
021=Surely thou art mad.
022=My honor is my life,and he has stolen it by defaming our order and defeating me.\m
023=That is wise of thee.
024=I must defeat him to restore my honor and that of my order,it is true,but a true knight approaches battles with strength and wits,and even with my wits it is clear that I am not now ready to fight him.\m
025=Please return,and help me.
026=I am quite disappointed with thy lack of compassion.
027=I implore thee to hear it,for it is of great import,and dire consequences arise from it.
028=I will return if I am able,but I have business to attend to first.
029=Very well,but quickly.
030=I'd give the rest of my right arm for a chance to take that rogue on again.He'd find out what sort of Knight I am.
031=Thou shouldst probably rest.
032=Thou art certainly right.
033=Perhaps I can defeat him.
034=That would be quite honorable of thee.
035=Let us join forces to defeat the villain.
036=I should get well first,for I would not wish to be a burden on thee.
037=If thou dost meet the rogue and defeat him,it would not only bring great honor to thee but also perhaps save my life.
038=I will seek him out.
039=Farewell.

041=\mI will leave it here for thee.

001=Greetings,traveler.What brings thee to an area of the Abyss as perilous as this.Art thou upon a quest,as I myself am?
002=What is thy quest?
003=No,I am not on a quest.
004=Many years ago,I began research into methods for turning lower metals into gold.During the course of my research,I discovered a new and better method that depends on a particular,very rare substance.I quest to find more of this substance.
005=Why is this method so much better?
006=Tell me of this substance.
007=zanium
008=the principal reagent
009=When I started,existing methods required a great many reagents to operate,and could produce only a fraction of an ounce of gold for each pound of lower metal.The new method requires a much smaller quantity of reagents and produces much more gold.However,@SS1 is rare,and I have been able to locate only trace amounts of it.
010=Tell me of this substance.
011=How is it collected?
012=Tell me of the mine area.
013=Where hast thou located the reagent?
014=It is a blue rock-like mineral called zanium.The only samples I have found have been on this floor of the Abyss in tunnels with rough-hewn walls.I believe there is a mining area in the southwest where there may be larger deposits,but I cannot gain access to it.
015=How is the new method better?
016=How is this mineral collected?
017=Tell me of the mine area.
018=Zanium has the property of being self-attractive.Deposits near the surface can be collected merely by walking over them while carrying a sample.In an underground environment such as this,if there is zanium present,there is likely to be some near the the surface.Thus,in a sense,it is collected automatically.
019=Tell me of this mine area.
020=Who might know more about the mine?
021=Perhaps I can help thee.
022=I do not know much.There is a small room in the southwestern region that is labelled "mine dispatch chamber..There appear to be some controls,but I know not how to operate them.
023=Is there anyone who would know about the controls?
024=How is this mineral collected?
025=Now that thou dost mention it,yes,there is one who may know something.One of those frightful ghouls in the catacombs used to be foreman in the mining sector.No ghoul has spoken to me since I killed one of them in self-defense.Perhaps thou couldst assist me?
026=What assistance dost thou need?
027=I am sorry,but I am unable to help thee.
028=If thou couldst talk to the miner ghoul and discover how to operate the dispatch chamber I would be most grateful.In addition,if thou wouldst enter the mining area,brave its dangers and collect at least eighty samples of zanium,I would reward thee with a large gold nugget created from lead.
029=I'll get thee information about the controls.
030=I will bring thee the zanium.
031=Well,if thou dost change thy mind,speak with me again.Farewell.
032=Wait.I will help thee.
033=Farewell.
034=Wouldst thou.Thou art indeed a kind soul.Take this small sample.Carry it through the mine,and it shall attract more of its kind.
035=I will leave it on the floor here for thee.
036=Farewell.
037=I thank thee kindly.Speak to me after thou hast obtained the pertinent information.Farewell.
038=Wait,I shall get the zanium.
039=Farewell.
040=I see.Then thou art an intrepid explorer indeed,to brave such depths as this.
041=Though I have no quest,do tell me of thine.
042=Indeed.And I must continue.Farewell.
043=Farewell.
044=Hast thou obtained the information I require?
045=Yes,I have.
046=No,I have not.
047=I have decided to get the zanium.
048=Excellent.What are the settings for the controls?
049=The settings are...
050=Oh,sorry.I do not have the settings.
051='Tis a shame.Return when thou hast it.
052=726
053=I thank thee very much.I shall attempt to enter the mine.
054=I thank thee for the information.It was indeed correct,but I was unable to retrieve the zanium because of numerous apparitions in the mine area.Wouldst thou retrieve it?
055=Yes.
056=No,I cannot.
057=Well,if thou dost reconsider,let me know.
058=Hast thou found eighty samples of zanium?
059=Yes,I have.
060=No,I have not.
061=Excellent.May I have them please?
062=Here they are.
063=Oh,sorry.I don't have them.
064=Very well.Return when thou hast found it.
065=I see none there!
066=I see only @GI53 samples there!
067=I thank thee kindly.Return in an hour and I shall give thee a gold nugget the size of which thou canst but imagine.
068=I said it would be an hour.Come back in @SI6C2 minutes.
069=Here is thy reward.I thank thee again.
070=Hello again,traveler.How may I help thee?
071=Tell me of thy quest.
072=I was just leaving
073=Hast thou reconsidered.Wilt thou help me after all?
074=Yes.What dost thou need?
075=No.I cannot help thee.
076=Hast thou reconsidered.Wilt thou get the zanium?
077=Yes,I shall.
078=No.Farewell.
079=I must thank thee again for retrieving the zanium.I am sorry,but I must excuse myself,as I am still busy with experiments.
080=I am sorry.Here are thy eighty samples of zanium.
081=I will go then and retrieve more zanium.
082=Please do.

007=What went on here before the collapse?

017=How does one use this chamber?

019=How does the chamber operate?
020=Canst thou help me use the chamber?

003=Indeed I have.He lives above with the lizardmen.
004=Zak?
005=I am sorry to hear it.I have not been able to find another candelabra like the one he stole from me.
006=I am glad to hear that.Perhaps I will be able to retrieve my candelabra from him now.
007=I don't know his real name,but he has come to be known simply as Zak.He was a Knight,I understand,before finding something in his adventures that caused him to lose his sanity.Recently he wandered by and made off with my candelabra.I don't expect ever to see it again.I hear that he also stole from the Knights some candle that they value highly.
008=I've never met him.
009=Indeed I have met him.He resides above us,on the level of the lizardmen.
010=Hello,@GS8.I thank thee again for telling me of the whereabouts of Zak.

004=No,I'm not interested.
005=What is this Golem?
006=Well then,I wish thee luck with whatever else thou searchest for.
007=Thou canst find him by heading west from the central chamber as far as thou canst and then turning left.He's on the island surrounded by lava.Be warned - he is quite tough!
008=The Golem was created by the Seer Lerin at the Knights' request as a test of valor.No Knights have come down to test themselves against him for quite a while now,but they used to frequently.I believe that a suitable prize awaits the one who can defeat him.
009=I'm sure I can defeat him!

002=Yes.
003=No.

005=I am glad to hear it.He must have told thee the code word he was searching for,then!
006=I'm afraid not.
007=Indeed he did.
008=I may have been mistaken.Perhaps I did not meet this Gurstang.
009=That seems quite unlikely.Perhaps thou mistook another mage for my friend Gurstang.If thou truly findest Gurstang,please let me know!
010=Yes.And what was it?
011=Other...
012=I don't think I should tell thee.
013=I may be able to help thee if thou tellst me the word.
014=Well then,it was...
015=Nay,I will not tell it to thee.
016=Hmm.I begin to think that perhaps thou hast not met Gurstang after all.I hope that thou wilt tell me the word he gives thee if thou dost see him.
017=It is Folanae.
018=Folanae
019=It is Folanau.
020=Folanau
021=It is Folanee.
022=Folanee
023=Hmm...@PS-2,thou sayest. No,that doesn't seem quite right.Art thou quite sure that was the word?
024=Maybe not.Perhaps the word was...
025=I thought it was.
026=I may be mistaken.
027=I would suggest that thou dost find Gurstang again and make sure of the code word this time.
028=Hmm...Folanae,thou sayest...\p perhaps...\p Yes,that must be it! The puzzle is becoming clearer!
029=What puzzle?
030=That's great.Now,I must be going.
031=Gurstang was searching for clues to the Key of Truth,a fabled object which has long been lost.Apparently,it is no longer in this world,so Gurstang and I looked for possible ways to bring it here from whatever world it is now in.The word that Gurstang found is an important clue.
032=What is its meaning?
033=We were of the opinion that praying at a shrine might bring it back.I would guess that the library might contain information regarding which shrine must be used.I suspect that any tome mentioning Gurstang's word,"Folanae" would hold the final clue to regaining the key.
034=I will seek out this information.
035=Good luck!
036=Where is this library?
037=It is located in the old Academy,in the northwest.Enter the Academy's main hall and head west; it should be on thy left.Good luck!
038=That's too bad.I wonder what happened to him.I hope that he has not been killed,or worse!
039=My friend Gurstang,a fellow Seer.He went downstairs a few months ago and I haven't seen him since.
040=Oh,that Gurstang.I just ran into him.
041=Sorry.I haven't seen him.
042=Why did he go down there?
043=He was on a search for the fabled Key of Truth.He must have fallen into the hands of Tyball,the wizard below.
044=I believe I have seen him.
045=I shall let thee know if I find him.
046=Please do.I fear for his safety.
047=Hello,@GS8.Hast thou found the Key of Truth?
048=Yes,I have found it.
049=Not yet.
050=Canst thou repeat what thou said earlier of it?
051=Hello,@GS8.Art thou not interested to learn the significance of the word Gurstang gave thee?
052=Yes,please tell me.
053=Not particularly.
054=Hello,@GS8.Hast thou found my friend Gurstang?
055=Yes,I have discovered him.
056=I'm afraid not.
057=I knew it could be found.I hope that the Key aids thee in thy quest.
058=I wish thee luck and speed in finding it.
059=Thank thee,I will continue on my quest to find it.
060=How didst thou say it could be found?
061=I think that praying at a shrine must have something to do with it.I would look in the library for a book that contains "Folanae" the word that Gurstang discovered,for a clue.
062=I will look there.Thanks!
063=Where's the library again?

005=That is too bad,for it has been closed for years now.
006='Twould not matter in any case,for the Academy has been closed for many a year.
007=I am not surprised,for the Academy is now closed,and few remember its days of glory.
008='Tis a pity that thou wert not here when Sir Cabirus was still alive.The Abyss was a thriving settlement,and our Academy was the center of it.Nobody seems to be interested in the higher arts any longer,though.
009=Indeed,simply to survive here is quite a feat.
010=But I am.Can you assist me in search for knowledge?
011=This is so.Since the Academy was closed,most of us have been content merely to eke out a meager existence in some small corner of the Abyss.
012=And the Academy.Is there aught left of it now?
013=I do not blame thee.The Abyss is a dangerous place.
014=I am afraid our once proud Academy has been infested by creatures who have no interest in the knowledge and wisdom contained there.To them,its halls offer notihg more than convenient shelter.It pains my heart to think of the Academy's decline from the days of old.

001=Hello,adventurer.I have a book I must deliver to my fellow mage Morlock,but I have not the time to give it to him in person.Wilt thou take it to him for me?
002=It would be my pleasure.
003=I don't have the time.
004=In what way might I benefit from such an act?
005=I am sorry to hear that.
006=Just the satisfaction of a job well done.
007=Very well,I will do this errand for thee.
008=I don't think so.
009=This book contains very powerful magic that is meant only for Morlock.Thou must promise not to open it.
010=Yes,I promise.
011=I'm sorry,I can't help thee.
012=Here is the book.Please give it to Morlock,and remember not to open it!
013=I'm sorry,I seem to have misplaced it.

021=Yes.
022=No,I still would rather not.
023=Then do so,please!
024=I thank thee very much.
025=I should have known better than to trust thee a second time.Perhaps thou shouldst run less dangerous errands in the future.
026=A little curious,wert thou.I expected as much,to be honest.It is well that I happened to have a second copy of the book.Please,be more careful with this one!
027=I make thee this offer.

001=I have not seen thee in these parts before.Art thou in league with Vilus?
002=Vilus.I have not heard of such a person.
003=Indeed I am.
004=Most assuredly I am not.
005=Not again.Thou,who art a servant of Vilus surely!
006=Yes,thou hast found me out.
007=Thou art mistaken.
008=Who is Vilus?
009=I was sure of it.Please,spare my life!
010=That I cannot do!
011=Why art thou afraid of me?

014=And so I am.Prepare to die!
015=No,I am not.Tell me of this Vilus.
016=Vilus used to be a Seer like the rest of us.A brilliant mage he was,but perhaps too much so for his own good.While exploring a method of casting powerful magic without runestones,he was overtaken by insanity.
017=And where is he now?
018=Whether he be alive or dead,I know not.He took over the caves to the northeast,filling them with vicious creatures and devious traps.No sane person ventures there any longer,least of all myself.Wilt thou run an errand there for me?
019=Assuredly.I have no fear of this Vilus.
020=Not if it as dangerous as thou sayst.
021=What should I do?
022=Oh,it's not really as dangerous as all that.A few creatures here and there...nothing that thou couldst not deal with easily.
023=Perhaps I will run this errand for thee.
024=And what dost thou want done in this place?
025=Vilus took a powerful book from the Library and failed to return it.It is named "On the Properties of Runestones..Return it to me and I shall teach thee to use thy magical abilities to their fullest.
026=It is as good as done.
027=Wait.I have it right here.
028=I have no time for this errand.
029=I thank thee greatly.Good luck in thy travels.
030=I am disappointed to hear that.If thou dost happen to find the book anyway,please let me know.
031=I am glad to hear it.I am sure that if thou wert allied with Vilus,I would be dead already.
032=Who is this Vilus?
033=Ah,'tis thee again.From a distance I mistook thee for one of Vilus' servants.Hast thou found "On the Properties of Runestones" for me yet?
034=Yes,here it is.
035=Nay,it has eluded me.
036=I am sure that that fiend Vilus has hidden it most deviously.I wish that I could aid thee in thy search!
037=Marvelous.I hope that it was not too much trouble to retrieve it.
038=He snaps his fingers and you are briefly bathed in a blue glow.
039=There,thou shouldst find that thy spellcasting skill is greater now.
040=I'm afraid that this is not the book I requested.
041=Perhaps this is it.
042=Sorry,I do not have it.
043=Yes.Where is it?
044=Here it is.
045=Sorry,I do not have it.

001=Aaah.What's that?\p...Oh,thou didst startle me.I was in the midst of a vivid dream,having just used some incense.I had a terrible vision of a great demon.
002=What didst thou dream of this demon?
003=Using incense caused this?
004=I did not mean to startle thee.
005=It was horrible.The demon is more powerful than thou canst imagine.I do not think he can be defeated by any mortal.
006=Thou speakst as if it were real,not just in a dream.
007=How didst thou come to have this dream?
008=This was no ordinary dream,but one dreamt after burning incense. Incense causes one to have vivid dreams,and they are always true in some way.Simply pass a block of incense over a torch to produce the smoke which,when inhaled,will cause one to dream.If my dream was of a demon,then some demon truly is threatening us.
009=I hope for our sake thou art wrong.
010=Is there nothing that can be done?
011=According to my dream,the demon is too powerful to be killed by any mortal.It would have to forced into leaving this world by some other means.I hope it can be done!
012=If I meet a demon,I will keep thy advice in mind.
013=Thank thee for thy time.
014=Ah,'tis thee again.
015=You seem more relaxed than the first time we met.
016=Hast thou any more information about the demon of your dream?
017=I have not used incense since the time of our meeting,so I have had no more dreams of demons.Perhaps I am better off - that dream was truly terrifying.

001=Ah,hello there.Art thou a mage,as I am?
002=I dabble in the mystical arts occasionally.
003=Yes,I am a mage.
004=I prefer to get by without resorting to magic.
005=Then I am sure thou wouldst be interested in my research.I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
006=What hast thou found?
007=Perhaps my research could benefit thee,although thou couldst probably not understand it.I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
008=What hast thou found?
009=It was long thought that the shrines of the Abyss served only to increase one's ability at some skill.But I have found that this is not necessarily the case.Apparently,some mantras exist that will produce objects,or dispense information.
010=What mantras are these?
011=Thy research sounds fascinating.
012=I have not been able to discover any specific mantras with these properties.However,it is said that there is a mantra which will direct one to a powerful object.The mantra has been divided into three parts,which must be reassembled to produce the original word.The tale is from long ago,so I know not its veracity.
013=Hast thou knowledge of any other mantras?
014=Thank thee for thy time.
015=Thou art quite welcome.Good luck in thy quests!
016=Sadly,I have no further knowledge of individual mantras.I hope that my research has been of some use to thee,however.
017=We shall see.
018=It certainly has.I thank thee kindly.
019=Hail,fellow mage!
020=Greetings,adventurer.
021=@SS1\nHow may I help thee?
022=I would like to know more of mantras.
023=I thank thee,but I need thy help no longer.
024=Unfortunately,I know of no other legendary mantras other than the one of which I told thee previously - the mantra which has been divided into three parts.Magical research is a long and arduous process,and only rarely does one discover truly interesting information.
025=I thank thee for the help.

030=And what want ye now?
031=Nothing.I'll be on my way.
032=Tell me again of the tombs.
033=Well,then,ye be a hero to th' Clan,an' most welcome here.What can I do for ye?
034=I need thy help to find and defeat Tyball.
035=Nothing,thanks.
036=Get ye gone from here,ye mangy dog!
037=Very well.Excuse me.
038=Good riddance!
039=Trust ye.Well,If I must,I must.But first,ye shall swear to me an oath,that ye mean no weal t' Tyball an' his lackeys.
040=Very well.
041=I shall do no such thing.
042=Swear,then that you're no friend of Tyball's!
043=I swear by my blood!
044=I swear by my sword!
045=I swear by the virtues!
046=Very well.Know then,that if ye be forsworn,all that ye hast sworn upon will turn against ye!
047=I have no fear.I stand by my oath.
048=I hereby recant and void my oath.
049=Here.Take ye this splinter of crystal.
050=Ye seem heavily laden,so I'll leave it here for ye.
051=What is it?
052=I found it three days ago while at my labors in the mines.At night it makes a faint,eerie keening.I've heard rumors of others who've found its like,and before long they're off searching for the tombs from which it came.
053=Why give it to me?
054=I don't want it.
055=It will do thee no harm,and may even help thee.I believ.it may give thee access to the tombs.
056=I told you I don't want it.
057=Why should I enter the tombs?
058=I believe the tombs to be of my ancient ancestors,built here long before the colony of the Abyss was formed.I've dreamt of them since finding the crystal.
059=Again,why give this crystal to me?
060=What lies in the tombs?
061=The way I figure it,the tombs have been defiled by an evil presence.This entity places the crystal where it'll be found,in order to draw unwary souls to its lair.I ask ye - find these tombs and cleanse them of this evil,so that others do not fall into this trap.
062=And why should I do this?
063=I will do what I can.
064=If ye can do this,I'm sure the beast responsible will have collected a sizable hoard from his victims.Ye may find the items useful in your quest against Tyball.But beware - disturb not the tombs themselves.Search for the entrance to the south of these prisons,where the pit trap spiders prowl.Carry the crystal with ye in your search - it may prove to be helpful.
065=Thank thee,I will see if this proves to be true.
066=I think you've gone crazy.However,I will take the crystal just in case...
067=I make thee this offer.
068=I demand you give me this!
069=I must appraise this deal.
070=I do not wish to continue.
071=Farewell.
072=I accept thy offer.

014=Secret doors.Who told thee of these secret doors.Did he tell thee of the chasm of fire they lead to,as well.It's becoming impossible to keep a secret around here these days.
015=Don't worry,I can keep a secret.
016=The chasm of fire.Why would I want to go to a chasm of fire?
017=Well,don't tell anyone,but I hid some things over there.But that's not important.
018=Surely it is,if they will help me defeat Tyball!
019=What things were these?

007=Indeed.Then know this: I believe the entrance lies directly north of this very spot.

009=A locked door blocks the way.But I still have the key hidden here in my cell.The key to the Key,as it were.

018=If you'll entrust me with your knowledge,I shall take up your quest.

015=I've had enough of riddles.
016=What gift?
017=I've had enough of riddles.
018=A crown it is,that's what we offer.The only thing for you in this room.The rest of the treasure is not yours to have.To steal it will mean your doom.
019=My doom?
020=What's so special about this crown?
021=Why do you offer me this?
022=Don't threaten me,runt.
023=My doom?
024=Why do you offer me this?
025=Don't threaten me,runt.
026=My doom?
027=Don't threaten me,runt.
028=A maze it is,you'll want to get through.Though many a fool it did swallow.What I have will enhance your eyes.And show you the yellow to follow.
029=So what is this item?
030=Why art thou helping me?
031=Bah,I don't need thy help.
032=Why art thou helping me?
033=Bah,I don't need thy help.
034=So where is this item?
035=Bah,I don't need thy help.
036=Our possessions have a magic upon them.To protect them from those who would take.Touching the wrong thing could mean instant death.Or at the least - a headache.
037=So how do I know which one to take?
038=How could an imp like you stop me from taking all?
039=I'm sick of this game.
040=A maze it is,you'll want to get through.Though many a fool it did swallow.What I have will enhance your eyes.And show you the yellow to follow.
041=So how do I know which one to take?
042=That's the question,is it not? And one you'll have to figure.Its one eye to help you is not bloodshot.And its size is smaller,not bigger.
043=How did you get the crown?
044=What if I take them all?
045=How did you get the crown?
046=The evil one,very bad.Here to hurt us all.We'll give you a gift if you're wise enough.Just to see him fall.
047=Who art thou?
048=I've had enough of riddles.
049=So where is this crown?
050=I've had enough of riddles.
051=A thief I told you,is what I am.And a grand theft it was,I suppose.Heisted the crown,slick as can be.Right from under the evil one's nose.
052=Why not give me the crown?
053=I don't believe you.I'll just take whatever I want.
054=Take just what you need.Some items are cursed.The golems guard others.So much the worse.
055=Is that all then?
056=How do I know which crown it is?
057=How did you get the crown?
058=How did you get the crown?
059=Can't just give it to anyone.My clues you must heed.Prove yourself worthy.And control your greed.
060=What other clues canst thou give me?
061=That's all I can tell you.It should be enough.Its really quite simple.If you're too dumb? - That's tough!
062=Wait,please tell me more.

004=I demand that thou dost release Arial!
005=What is thy fiendish plot?
006=Oh,I'm afraid that that is quite impossible.I need the body of an innocent one to act as a vessel,and I am afraid that thine wilt not do.Besides,after all the trouble I went to,it would be a pity to let her go now,dost thou not think?
007=Oh,thou dost wonder why I abducted poor Arial.Perhaps I should spare thee so that thou canst see my incantation.The sight of a demon entering the body of a human is not one to be missed.
008=I think thou art a villain and not worthy to live!
009=Ah,but regardless of my worthiness,I am afraid that I will live,and that thou wilt not.
010=Very well.If I must kill thee,I will.
011=Hm.I believe that the question is not whether thou must kill me,but whether thou canst.And the answer,of course,is no.

005=Why dost thou seek a demon? Art thou in league with it?
006=I plan to destroy it.

013=Better I should ask thee.Art thou in league with the wizard,Tyball?
014=Ah,good luck to thee.I am not sure,but there is a large chamber in the center of the lava,guarded by many of the most fearsome creatures I have ever heard tell of.I stole a key to the door which leads to the chamber's portal,but I fled for my life when I saw what was beyond.I cannot say if there is a demon there.
015=Where is this door?
016=Please tell me more.
017=It is to the south,down the main hall.It is unmistakable,with devilish devices upon it.If thou dost wish to enter the door,I will give thee the key,as I do not intend to use it again!
018=Yes,that would be very helpful.
019=No,I will find another way and avoid the beasts.
020=I came to these depths on a quest to find the legendary gold mines.While I was exploring,an evil magic was done,and I became trapped here,my return blocked by a powerful wizard.I have been here for weeks now,trying to survive and find another way home.I have had almost no food,as the creatures I have killed are too foul to eat.
021=The way home is open for thee now.Leave now!
022=Here is some food.Wilt thou tell me more of thy exploring?

025=I must finish my quest.But why dost thou stay here?
026=I may or may not find use for it.Thank thee,I must make haste.

029=I shall cross regardless.Thank thee for thy help.
030=Hah! I have faced worse threats than thee in these depths.Prepare thyself!
031=I apologize for my harshness.Please tell me about thy journey.

033=I am sorry.I will leave thee in peace.
034=I know no such person.I know only that I am trapped here by a wizard.
035=How did you get trapped?
036=Then I will take my leave before I'm trapped as well.
037=The wizard is dead.I will leave thee to thy escape.
038=Thou art toying with me most cruelly! Leave me!

040=Yes,I'm sorry,here it is..
041=No,I have no food to give thee.
042=I thank thee kindly.May thy quest come to a happier end than mine!
043=I thank thee most kindly.Here,I found this wand with some bones far to the southwest of here.I believe that the bones were those of a great wizard.They were near a Knight's remains.There was more,but I had to flee a fearsome stone creature before I could gather it up.
044=Thank thee.I will be on my way now.
045=Well,leave me then,as I must rest before I make another attempt at escape.
046=Goodbye,then.

001=So,another comrade is caught by the Abyss.What was thy crime,pray-tell?
002=I committed no crime.
003=I have always lived here as a peaceful fisherman.
004=I am accused of kidnapping a girl.
005=Hm,perhaps the same girl that I hear was carried through these upper caves by a Troll.
006=Yes,that must be the one!
007=Perhaps it was another.
008=Where did he take her?
009=Well,whoever she was,she's here no longer.I don't know how far the Troll was planning on taking her,but given the strength of a Troll,he'll not likely run out of energy any time soon.
010=I must be off immediately!
011=Then there is no hope of rescuing her.
012=Hold on just a minute.Surely that girl is in trouble,but if thou dost learn the ways of the Abyss first,thou wilt surely have a better chance of rescuing her.
013=And what should I know of the Abyss?
014=Just tell me what areas I should stay clear of.
015=Well,thou shouldst know that most of the inhabitants of the Abyss are unfriendly.It's not so much a question of what areas to avoid as of which areas are relatively safe.
016=Look for the Banner of Cabirus -- a tapestry with an ankh,such as we have -- as a sign of civilization.Any people or creatures thou dost find past the Banner are more likely to talk with thee than eat thee.Speaking of ankhs,thou wouldst do well to search out the other thing they represent: the shrines.
017=What use do they serve?
018=Where can I find them?
019=When thou dost see a large,plain ankh standing on the ground,thou hast found a shrine to Virtue.It is said that if thou hast been virtuous,and dedicated to increasing thy abilities,praying at a shrine with the correct mantra will allow thee to enhance thy abilities.It is said that there is one in the southeast area of these upper caves,but I have not seen it myself.
020=I thank thee for thy information.
021=I must be off to use the advice thou hast given me.
022=Well,good luck in thy travels.Thou art always welcome here.
023=Oh,thou art an innocent passerby,eh.Perhaps thou art here on a tour of the Abyss.Or art thou a census taker? A tax collector.Eh?
024=I was thrown here wrongfully,and seek freedom.
025=Yes,I am simply touring.
026=I was tasked by Baron Almric to map the Abyss.
027=Already been driven mad,I see.'Tis a pity,truly,to see the mind go on one so young.Ah,well,death is probably thy best hope.Good luck.
028=Thrown here against thy will I will believe,but wrongfully is a different matter.No need to pretend amoungst us,though.Not a one of us believes in Almric's petty justice.
029=Now that thou'rt here,thou shouldst stay with us.The creatures beyond are far worse than anything Almric could do to thee.Right here near the door is safest.Trust me.
030=What is out there that is so bad?
031=Dost thou ever venture outside?
032='Tis unbelievable.Once,it is said,all the races here lived in harmony.Not now,that's for certain.The Gobs on this level are constantly at war,with each other as well as everyone else.
033=And below are things I dare not speak of.'Tis rumored that some remnants of civilization remain in most colonized areas of the Abyss,but I have never had the courage or interest to find out.
034=How can I find whatever civilization remains?
035=Dost thou have any advice for survival?
036=A hearty welcome to thee.Hast thou decided to stay with us?
037=No,my destiny is elsewhere.
038=Perhaps for a while.
039=I am glad to hear it.This is by far the safest place in the Abyss.
040=I think not,but I would like any advice thou canst give me.
041=What wouldst thou know of?
042=Hast thou news of a kidnapped girl?
043=What is life like up here?
044=What inhabitants should I avoid?

001=A human it is.We have been watching you.A fine race you are,but somewhat unknowledgable.To divide all your intelligence amongst yourselves as you do - it does not seem correct.And your bodies must be so hard to maintain.Still,we are impressed that you do as well as you do.
002=Do you not miss having bodies?
003=Is it not equally difficult to consist only of globes of light?

006=I must know very little compared to you.
